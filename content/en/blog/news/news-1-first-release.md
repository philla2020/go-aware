## Welcome!

We are very excited to announce the first release of ***Golang Aware*** site.

***What about the name of the site?***
> ***Awareness*** is the state of being conscious of something. The purpose of the site is to spread the knowledge of the
`go` language in a clear a and practical way!
We are "aware" that there a lot of sites, well done, that have the same goal and we are happy because we value and respect
whoever spend its free time fixing knowledges for others on the web.
We hope you appreciate our effort and we would love in case you liked to contribute on it. If you are a passionate of `golang` welcome on board!
Simply *fork* the site and propose your `pull request`!

The site aims to share knowledge on this awesome programming language that can keep you company for:
- free programming
- your DevOps daily tasks
- concurrent programming where performances really matter
- many other contexts as the popularity and community are constantly growing

Follow the news section, here weâ€™ll announce ***new site contents***. We have a lot of material to write to cover all the knowledges
aroud `go` and this request time to keep it simple and complete. So, follow us and if you like our work don't forget to star the project on [gitbub](https://github.com/mas2020-golang/go-aware).

Stay connected and **happy coding**!
