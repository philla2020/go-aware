## Welcome!

We are very excited to announce the first release of ***Golang Aware*** site.

***What about the name of the site?***
> ***Awareness*** is the state of being conscious of something. The purpose of the site is to spread the knowledge of the
`go` language in a clear and practical way!
We are "aware" that there a lot of good sites that have the same goal and we are happy because we value and respect
whoever spend its free time fixing knowledge for the web community.
We hope you appreciate our effort, and we would love your contribution to it. If you love `golang`, you are in the right place!
Simply *fork* the site and propose your `pull request`!

The site aims to share knowledge on this awesome programming language that can keep you company for:

- free programming
- your DevOps daily tasks
- concurrent programming where performances really matter
- many other contexts as the popularity and community are constantly growing

Follow the news section, here weâ€™ll announce ***new site contents***. We have a lot of material to write to cover all the knowledge
around `go` and this request time to keep it simple and complete. So, follow us and if you like our work don't forget to star the project on [gitbub](https://github.com/mas2020-golang/go-aware).

Special thanks go to :
- the [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) the awesome engine used to create the contents
- the [docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/) template we chased

Stay connected and **happy coding**!
